1. INTRODUCTION
   
1.1 Introduction: 
Gender recognition through voice is a captivating and rapidly advancing field that harnesses the 
power of technology to discern the gender of an individual based solely on their voice. With the 
remarkable progress in machine learning and artificial intelligence, we now have the capability to 
analyze intricate speech patterns and identify the subtle nuances that differentiate male and female 
voices. 
This technology finds application in various domains, spanning from security and healthcare to 
entertainment. In the realm of security, voice-based gender recognition can be employed in systems 
designed to detect potential threats or intrusions. By analyzing voice patterns, these systems can 
help identify the gender of individuals in real-time, aiding in enhanced security protocols.
The implications of gender recognition through voice extend beyond these specific applications. It 
has the potential to transform how we interact with technology on a daily basis. From personalized 
voice assistants that adapt to individual voices and preferences, to voice-controlled smart homes 
that recognize and respond to different family members, the possibilities are vast. 
In the healthcare sector, gender recognition through voice holds promise for diagnosing voice 
disorders and monitoring patients' vocal health. By analyzing voice characteristics, medical 
professionals can gain insights into specific gender-related vocal conditions and develop tailored 
treatment plans. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way voice-related healthcare 
services are provided. 
Moreover, in the entertainment industry, gender recognition through voice can be leveraged to 
create more immersive and realistic virtual assistants, video game characters, and animated avatars. 
By accurately determining the gender of users based on their voice, these interactive experiences 
can deliver personalized and engaging content that resonates with individual preferences.
However, it is essential to ensure the ethical and responsible use of this technology. Safeguarding 
privacy and avoiding any form of discrimination based on gender are critical considerations that 
need to be addressed in the development and deployment of voice-based gender recognition 
systems.
In conclusion, gender recognition through voice presents exciting opportunities across various 
sectors, including security, healthcare, and entertainment. By leveraging machine learning and 
artificial intelligence, we can unlock the potential of voice analysis to accurately determine gender.
 
1.2 Literature Survey: 
 After conducting an extensive review of 6-7 research papers in the field of gender 
recognition using voice, it becomes evident that a range of algorithms, including Support 
Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and 
Logistic Regression, have been employed to develop gender recognition systems using voice 
datasets. These algorithms have demonstrated high accuracy rates when applied to various 
datasets.
 Within our project, we utilized these algorithms on the Kaggle dataset and achieved the 
highest accuracy of 98.42% using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This outcome 
highlights the effectiveness of the CNN model as a method for gender recognition utilizing 
voice datasets.
Nonetheless, it is important to acknowledge that further research is required to enhance the 
performance of these algorithms across diverse datasets and under varying conditions. 
Continued exploration and experimentation will facilitate the refinement and optimization 
of these models, enabling them to deliver robust gender recognition results in real-world 
scenarios.

1.3 Project Plan: 
 Goal:
1. To develop an AI/ML model that can accurately recognize the gender of a speaker 
in real-time using their voice.
 Scope:
1. Collecting and preparing a dataset of real-time audio recordings of male and female 
speakers: This involves gathering a diverse set of audio recordings from individuals 
of different genders and backgrounds. The dataset should be appropriately labeled to 
indicate the gender of each speaker.
2. Developing a machine learning model that can analyze the audio in real-time and 
accurately classify the gender of the speaker: This step involves designing and 
training a model using techniques such as deep learning or traditional machine 
learning algorithms. The model should be able to process audio inputs and make 
predictions about the gender of the speaker with a high degree of accuracy.
3. Integrating the model into a real-time voice recognition system: Once the model is 
developed, it needs to be integrated into a real-time voice recognition system. This 
system should be able to take audio input from a microphone or another source, 
process it using the trained model, and provide immediate feedback on the gender 
of the speaker. The integration may involve developing a user interface, handling 
real-time audio streaming, and implementing the necessary audio processing and 
feature extraction steps.


2. Investigation


2.1 Data Pre-processing: 
Data preprocessing in voice-based gender recognition involves several important steps to ensure the 
dataset is ready for ML algorithm implementation. Here are the key points in a more detailed 
manner:
Real feature extraction from voice: In addition to the provided features like mean frequency, 
standard deviation of frequency, skewness, and kurtosis, real features need to be extracted from the 
raw voice data. These features could include fundamental frequency (pitch), formant frequencies, 
energy distribution, and statistical measures like maximum, minimum, and average values. 
Techniques such as Fourier analysis, linear predictive coding (LPC), or Mel-frequency cepstral 
coefficients (MFCC) can be used to extract these features, capturing valuable information from the 
voice signals.
Handling missing values: Missing values can occur in the dataset, both in the provided features 
and the extracted features. It is essential to address these missing values before feeding the data into 
ML algorithms. Missing values can be handled by either removing the corresponding samples with 
missing values, imputing them with mean or median values, or using more advanced techniques 
such as interpolation or regression to estimate the missing values. This ensures that the dataset is 
complete and suitable for further analysis.
Converting categorical labels: To make the dataset compatible with ML algorithms, categorical 
labels such as "male" and "female" need to be converted into numerical labels. This conversion 
typically involves assigning a value of 0 to one gender (e.g., male) and 1 to the other gender (e.g., 
female). By converting categorical labels into numerical form, the algorithm can process the data 
effectively and make accurate predictions. 
Analyzing feature correlations: Understanding the correlations between different features is 
important for feature selection and model performance. By computing correlation coefficients, such 
as Pearson's correlation coefficient, between pairs of features, it becomes possible to assess the 
degree of correlation between them. Visualizing these correlations through a correlation matrix 
provides insights into which features are strongly correlated. Highly correlated features can 
introduce redundancy and potentially impact the model's performance. Thus, identifying and 
addressing highly correlated features is crucial to reduce dimensionality and improve the efficiency 
of the model.
Dimensionality reduction: Highly correlated features can lead to the problem of dimensionality, 
where the dataset has a high number of features compared to the number of samples. This can 
negatively impact the performance of ML algorithms. To address this, dimensionality reduction 
techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or feature selection algorithms can be 
employed. These techniques aim to retain the most informative features while reducing the 
dimensionality of the dataset. By reducing the number of features, the model becomes more efficient 
and less prone to overfitting.
By following these comprehensive data preprocessing steps, including real feature extraction, 
handling missing values, converting categorical labels, analyzing feature correlations, and applying 
dimensionality reduction techniques, the dataset is appropriately prepared for ML algorithm 
implementation. This preprocessing ensures that the algorithms can effectively learn from the voice 
data and accurately predict the gender of the speakers in real-time.

2.2 ML algorithms implementation: 

We implemented five popular ML algorithms for gender recognition using voice datasets. 
• SVM (Support Vector Machine): SVM is a popular classification algorithm that aims to 
find a hyperplane that separates two classes. We implemented the SVM algorithm using the 
scikit-learn library in Python. We used the Radial basis function (RBF) kernel, which is a 
popular kernel for SVM. 
We trained the SVM model using the training dataset and tested it on the testing dataset. We 
evaluated the performance of the model using various performance metrics such as 
accuracy. The results showed that the SVM model has an accuracy of 96.29%, which is a 
good performance. 
• Random forest: Random forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple 
decision trees to make a final decision. We implemented the random forest algorithm using 
the scikit-learn library in Python. We used 100 decision trees in our model. 
We trained the random forest model using the training dataset and tested it on the testing 
dataset. We evaluated the performance of the model using various performance metrics such 
as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results showed that the random forest model 
has an accuracy of 95.47% , which is the highest accuracy among all the models. 
• KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours): KNN is a simple algorithm that finds the K closest data 
points to a test point and predicts its label based on the majority label of its neighbours. 
We implemented the KNN algorithm using the scikit-learn library in Python. We set the 
number of neighbours to 5. We trained the KNN model using the training dataset and tested 
it on the testing dataset. We evaluated the performance of the model using various 
performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results showed 
that the KNN model has an accuracy of 95.11%, which is the lowest accuracy among all 
the models. 
• Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Powerful machine learning technique used for 
gender recognition from voice. By converting voice data into spectrograms or MFCCs, 
CNNs can learn intricate patterns and features from the audio signals. The network 
architecture typically consists of convolutional layers to extract relevant information, 
followed by fully connected layers for classification into male or female categories. Through 
extensive training on labelled data and optimization of parameters, CNNs can achieve high 
accuracy i.e., 98.42%, in predicting gender from voice samples. This approach harnesses 
the capability of CNNs to analyse voice data and discern distinctive characteristics between 
male and female voices.
CNN models have shown remarkable performance in various computer vision tasks, 
including gender recognition using voice datasets. By leveraging their ability to 
automatically learn and extract relevant features from the input data, CNNs can capture 
subtle patterns and nuances in voice signals, enabling accurate gender classification.
• Decision Tree Classifier: It is a machine learning algorithm that builds a decision tree from 
the training data and uses it to make predictions. It is a popular algorithm for classification 
problems and can handle both categorical and continuous input features. 
We implemented the KNN algorithm using the scikit-learn library in Python using the 
training dataset and tested it on the testing dataset. We evaluated the performance of the 
model using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 
The results showed that the Decision Tree Classifier model has an accuracy of 97.67%.

KNN algorithm (95.11%). This indicates that the random forest algorithm is the best algorithm for 
gender recognition using voice datasets.

3.2 Discussion:
In this project, we implemented five popular ML algorithms for gender recognition using voice 
datasets. We evaluated the performance of our model using several performance metrics, including 
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 
We also performed a comparison of the performance of different machine learning algorithms used 
in our study. The results showed that the CNN Model outperformed the other algorithms, achieving 
an Accuracy of 98.42%, Precision of 98.45%, Recall of 98.42%, and an F1 Score of 98.43%. 

3.3 Result: 
After thoroughly evaluating several advanced algorithms, including Support Vector Machines 
(SVM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), and 
Decision Tree, and considering important factors like accuracy, precision, and recall, we have 
concluded that the CNN model is the most effective for our gender recognition project. The CNN 
model has demonstrated superior performance compared to other algorithms, making it the ideal 
choice. Specifically, we achieved an impressive accuracy of 98.42% with the CNN model.
1. The model takes an input vector of a specific length (specified by vector_length).
2. It has several layers that transform the input data to make predictions: 
   The first layer has 256 units and processes the input data.
   After each layer, some information is randomly dropped out to prevent overfitting. 
   There are additional layers with 256, 128, and 64 units, gradually reducing the 
    complexity of the data.
3. The final layer has one unit and uses the sigmoid function to produce a value between 0 and 1.
   This value represents the probability of the input being male or female. 
4. The model is trained using a technique called "binary cross-entropy" and the "Adam" 
optimization algorithm. These help the model learn to make accurate predictions.


In summary, the model takes input data, passes it through several layers to extract relevant features, 
and then predicts the probability of the input being male or female. The model is trained to make 
accurate predictions using the binary cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.
In addition to the implementation of the gender recognition model using the CNN architecture, we 
have also developed a user-friendly UI to enhance the overall user experience. This application 
allows users to interact with the gender recognition system seamlessly, providing an intuitive 
interface for inputting audio data and obtaining the predicted gender with corresponding 
probabilities. 
The application simplifies the process of gender recognition through voice by providing a 
convenient platform for users to either record their voice or upload an audio file for analysis. The 
recorded audio or uploaded file is then processed by the CNN model, which extracts relevant 
features from the input data.
 
3.3 Extended analysis: 
 Improve the training data: The quality and quantity of the training data can have a 
significant impact on the accuracy of an algorithm. Future work could focus on improving 
the training data by collecting more data, cleaning up the data, and removing any biases 
from the data. 
 Use a more powerful algorithm: There are many different types of algorithms that can be 
used for machine learning tasks. Some algorithms are more powerful than others and can 
achieve higher accuracy. Future work could focus on using a more powerful algorithm, such 
as a deep learning algorithm. 
 Use ensemble learning: Ensemble learning is a technique that combines multiple 
algorithms to improve the accuracy of the overall model. Future work could focus on using 
ensemble learning to combine multiple algorithms to achieve higher accuracy. 
 Use transfer learning: Transfer learning is a technique that can be used to improve the 
accuracy of an algorithm by using knowledge from a related task. Future work could focus 
on using transfer learning to improve the accuracy of the algorithm by using knowledge 
from a related task.

4. Summary

In this project, we began by comparing multiple machine learning algorithms for gender recognition 
based on voice datasets. After evaluating their performance using various metrics, we identified the 
CNN model as the most effective. 
To start the process, the audio data is recorded and saved as a .wav file. This recorded data is then 
preprocessed using techniques such as MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), MEL 
spectrogram, and other relevant features. These preprocessing steps extract important 
characteristics from the audio that can help in determining gender.
Next, the preprocessed audio data is fed into the CNN model. The model learns patterns and features 
from the preprocessed audio data and makes predictions about the gender of the speaker.
The CNN model consists of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, dropout layers, and 
dense (fully connected) layers. The convolutional layers extract relevant audio features by 
convolving filters over the input data. The dense layers further process the features and make the 
final gender prediction. 
 
In summary, this project implements gender recognition using a CNN model on audio recordings. 
The process involves recording audio, preprocessing the data using various techniques, and feeding 
it into the CNN model for gender prediction. The CNN model's ability to extract and learn intricate 
audio features contributes to accurate gender classification.
