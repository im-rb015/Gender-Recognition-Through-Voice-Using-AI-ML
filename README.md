# Gemder-Recognition-Through-Voice-Using-AI-ML
This project implements gender recognition using a CNN model on audio recordings.  The process involves recording audio, preprocessing the data using various techniques, and feeding  it into the CNN model for gender prediction. The CNN model's ability to extract and learn intricate  audio features contributes to accurate gender classification.
